Develop a static, single-page Healthcare Dashboard UI in React that visually replicates the provided reference image exactly:
üîó Referenced Design: image is attached

This dashboard must showcase frontend skills by converting a detailed healthcare UI design into a pixel-perfect, fully responsive web page. No interactivity or dynamic logic is needed.

Core Features
Header with logo, search bar (non-functional), user avatar, notification, and add button

Fixed left sidebar with static navigation links

Main dashboard content area with:

Static anatomical figure and health indicators

Static health status cards

Monthly calendar with fixed appointment slots

Upcoming appointment cards

Activity summary with static bar chart

User Inputs
None ‚Äî all data is static. Use mock data from JavaScript files. No clicks, edits, or dynamic actions.

Outputs
A single responsive React-based web page that:

Exactly replicates the reference image

Displays all elements using mock static data

Is visually identical on desktop, tablet, and mobile

Renders content via reusable components

Workflow Logic
Set up the project using React (Vite or Create-React-App).

Use only functional components and props.

Organize components as:

App ‚Üí layout container

Header, Sidebar, DashboardMainContent

Inside DashboardMainContent:

DashboardOverview

AnatomySection

HealthStatusCards

CalendarView

UpcomingSchedule

ActivityFeed

SimpleAppointmentCard (reusable)

Store mock data in separate JS files like appointments.js, healthData.js

Use props to render static content from these data files

Apply styling using CSS, CSS Modules, or Styled Components

Layout using Flexbox and CSS Grid for full responsiveness

Replicate exact spacing, alignment, shadows, colors, border radii

Add accessibility (e.g., alt tags) where applicable

UI Requirements
Replicate the  image attached exactly

Theme: clean, minimalist, professional

Colors: shades of light blue, gray, white; green for ‚ÄúHealthy Heart‚Äù, red for ‚ÄúLungs‚Äù, calendar blues

Typography: match style, weights, spacing, and sizes

Icons: sidebar, search, profile, anatomy ‚Äî replicate visually using Font Awesome, Lucide, or similar

Imagery: static human anatomy illustration and status labels ("Lungs", "Teeth", "Bone")

Layout: consistent with the reference, including sidebar width, card grid, spacing, and content alignment

Shadow & Border Radius: soft, subtle effects to match the original

Limitations / Constraints
‚ùå No interactivity (no buttons, click handlers, state changes, useEffect, etc.)

‚ùå Do NOT implement API calls or live data

‚ùå Do NOT use any functionality not visible in the image

‚ùå Do NOT add personal or resume files in the repo

‚úÖ Only static mock data rendering

‚úÖ Use reusable components and clean prop-based design

‚úÖ Must be pixel-perfect and responsive
